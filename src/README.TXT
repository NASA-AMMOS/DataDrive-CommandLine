This is the M2020 DataDrive CLI bundle.

Once installed, you must configure DataDrive by running "ddrv config". Use "ddrv config --help" to see 
the available options, including the default values.

The DataDrive CLI extends functionality of the OCS Command line tools by adding support for
the following commands:
1) subscribe: Package-based subscriptions, where files added to OCS is automatically downloaded to the
   local system;
2) publish: Package-based publish sessions, where files added to a local directory can be automatically
   push to a remote OCS package.

For help information, use "ddrv [command] --help".

Additional help is available at: 

TODO: ADD Help URL
